# Analyses

This directory contains scripts and subdirectories for performing various analyses related to gene expression divergence between Red and NonRed pools in the study. Below is a description of the files and folders included.

## Contents

### Subdirectories
1. **[DE_analysis](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/tree/main/Analyses/DE_analysis)**  
   Scripts and resources for analyses of genes differentially expressed (DE) between Red and NonRed, including visualization and statistical testing.

2. **[DS_analysis](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/tree/main/Analyses/DS_analysis)**  
   Scripts for Differential Splicing analysis between Red and NonRed.

### Files
1. **[DE_Plotting_data.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/DE_Plotting_data.R)**  
   A helper script for preparing datasets used in differential expression plots.

2. **[Fig6_effectFuns.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/Fig6_effectFuns.R)**  
   Contains functions for calculating and visualizing experimental effects in both expression levels and splicing, used in Figure 6 of the study.

3. **[MatingAssay_Fig1.S6.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/MatingAssay_Fig1.S6.R)**  
   Analyses and plotting results of maating success assays. Generates Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S6. 

4. **[Mishra_et.al_SBGE.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/Mishra_et.al_SBGE.R)**  
   A script for loading and processing external data on sex-biased gene expression (SBGE) from Mishra et al. 2024: https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae234 

5. **[SAcandidates_TableS3.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/SAcandidates_TableS3.R)**  
   Generates Table S3, testing for overlap between candidates identified in the current study vs. sexually antagonistic candidates identified in past studies.

6. **[boot_permute.R](https://github.com/mchlleliu/MaleLimitedEvo/blob/main/Analyses/boot_permute.R)**  
   Provides bootstrapping and permutation functions for statistical testing in various analyses.
